### Hi there, I'm a CS student from Italy

- ðŸ’» I am interested in back-end development and I work mainly in Python, Go and C++. I am particularly fond of Python with type hints, I think it strikes a nice balance between dynamic and static typing.
- ðŸ“« I am currently learning C++ to work with computer graphics and digital image processing applications.
-  ðŸ”­ In the future I'd like to get better at Go and study Machine Learning.

#### Projects I'm planning to build
- A compiler in C++ and/or Go
- A database in C++
- A 2D and/or a 3D game in C++
- More telegram bots in Python

#### Achievements
- I created and currently manage a very active Telegram community with more than 10.000 total users and 70.000 monthly messages. I developed [a bot](https://github.com/rt2013G/hexa-bot) that helps with administration tasks and also provides different means to engage users via chat based games.
