### Hi there, I'm a CS student from Italy

- ðŸ’» I am interested in Computer Graphics, Game Development and Game Design. I've also built some back-end apps.
- ðŸ“« I have experience with C, C++, Python and Go.

#### Achievements
- I created and currently manage a very active Telegram community with more than 10.000 total users and 70.000 monthly messages. I developed [a bot](https://github.com/rt2013G/hexa-bot) that helps with administration tasks and also provides different means to engage users via chat based games.
