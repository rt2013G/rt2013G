### Hi there, I'm a CS student from Italy

- ðŸ”­ I am interested in back-end development and I'm currently working with Python and Golang. I really enjoy these two languages due to their simple and easy to understand syntax. I am particularly fond of Python with type hints, I think it strikes a nice balance between dynamic and static typing.
-  ðŸ“« In the future I'd like to learn the C++ language and study Machine Learning.

#### Projects and Achievements
- I created and currently manage a very active Telegram community with more than 10.000 total users and 70.000 monthly messages. I developed [a bot](https://github.com/rt2013G/hexa-bot) that helps with administration tasks and also provides different means to engage users via chat based games.
